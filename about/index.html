<p>I make things, and I am sad sometimes. Sometimes I wonder if I'm in the right career. Then I remember that the one thing I'm good at in life is making things look kind of cool. Then I keep going to work every day, wondering when everyone will realize what a fraud I am. Until then, I'm just a mercenary. Except that I use a Wacom stylus, and I don't kill people with it. I just use it to draw stuff. For money. For other people. That's why I'm a mercenary, that's the joke. Did you get the joke?</p>
