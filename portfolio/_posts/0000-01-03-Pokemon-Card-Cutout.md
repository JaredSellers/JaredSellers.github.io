description: After seeing similar cards online, I had to try it for myself. This was 16 Voltorb cards, with arranged filler cards to fill space. Each card was hand cut with a craft knife, and glued into place before framing. The result is a shadow-box effect showcasing popular pokemon. Super fun, and super time-consuming.
