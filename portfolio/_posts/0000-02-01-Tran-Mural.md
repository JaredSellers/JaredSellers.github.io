description: A mural commissioned by Beavercreek Martial Arts in my home state of Ohio, this was easily one of the largest paintings I have ever worked on. Coming in at 43'x 13', it was a massive full wall painting in the martial arts studio. Over 60 hours went into the conception and execution, and now hundreds of students are greated with 7 of life and fiction's greatest martial arts legends.
