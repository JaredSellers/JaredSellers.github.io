The stars are beautiful tonight. I watch them nightly without fail, cautiously looking for answers in the night sky. Sprawled less than gracefully over the patchy hill of wild grass, I spend hours getting lost in the vast expanse. After a long day of tired travel, the knoll I lay on becomes my bed, the stars my respite from harsh realities. As I stare onward and past the brightest of them, I stay mesmerized by the idea that life is out there, possibly watching me back. But what would they see? A grassy hill, a man, his carrots. Would that mean anything to anyone? I find it’s best not to think about that part. All I need to worry myself with, is my carrots. 

I have lots of carrots. A countless bunch, continually growing to be harvested. They stretch as far as the eye can see, tidy rows of green, leafy stalks. The carrots are my salvation, my life’s purpose, my magnum opus. So I dedicate myself to them. I spend my days engulfed in their needs, weeding and harvesting.  There are enough carrots that I can’t tend to them all on my own. After as many harvests as suit my fancy, I leave to care for another vast field. I wander through the overgrown fields of months and years gone by, taming the weeds and cultivating the fields for a number of weeks until more carrots can grow again. It’s important to me to see my loved ones, I can never go too long without stopping by or someone might get restless.

Each field grows it’s own personality as much as it grows carrots. Some fields are impatient, strangling out the plants with toxic soil and gravel. Some of them are soothing, like a mother tending it’s child. The fine earthy ground gently kissing the carrots as they grow. I speak to them, and they speak back with their fruitful harvest and swaying breeze. I spend most of my time throughout the year tending to Gwendolyn, the south field. She has been there from the beginning, her carrots are second to none. She cares for me, and I care for her. Her valley is nestled between two scenic mountains, rivers flowing into deltas beneath, nourishing her life giving body.

I’ve only ever climbed her mountains once, though I have had every opportunity in the world to do so. That would take me away from the fields, and without a gardener, the carrots would suffer. I stay, for there are greater purposes at work. This spring has been fruitful, which means I must get back to Gwendolyn. The river has been widening, so I am almost home, maybe a day or two’s journey. Then I will be again in her sweet embrace, to tend to her carrots for another season.

As I pass the split of the river, I’m greeted to the first of many rows, curving gently off into the distance. Like a reunion of two long forgotten lovers, the sight leaves flutters in my core. Even without my tending hands, Gwendolyn takes care of herself. White blossoms speckle the tops of her green hair, a sure sign that the carrots have begun to grow wild.  But despite the lack of her caretaker, she is still as green and lush as the day that I left. 

I wander further, carefully passing directly over each row of wild carrots, barely visible since I left. The rows bend more visibly as I count them down, and a knot forms in my stomach. It is Gwendolyn’s only flaw, one of my making. I have planted straight rows for longer than I remember, they are the one true way to garden. Unerring paths, unprejudiced by surroundings, that is the both the model for my garden and my heart. But Gwendolyn is different, the last of her kind. I refuse to replant her, as it has become as much a part of her as my past is a part of me. She was one of the first fields I ever planted, and it’s a relic of a time long past. If I were to turn, to walk with the rows instead of across them, I would walk for hours, days, and years without ever finding an end. Each row finds its way back to itself, in perfectly formed concentric circles. That is my sin, for what lies at the very center of those circles is the end of all things. It is a secret centuries old and the only reminder of my past, and of my future. It is my way back.

The metal is speckled yet smooth, cool to the touch on the dark side of the large, cylindrical monument. Reaching far over my head, it watched Gwendolyn in my absence. The small seam of an unopened door framed the control panel. I couldn’t bring myself to face it, I hide in the shadows of the morning sun, where I am comfortable ignoring the inevitable. I’m not ready to press the buttons even a single time more. Not until I have reached my goal. I’m unsure of how the door works, I am not a smart man. But I do know where it will take me. It will open one day, I will walk through it, and it will all be over. The carrots will be my key. 

As Gwendolyn grows more lovely every day, so do I become more anxious. The day draws closer, and I wonder if I was up to the task. The monument is a constant reminder, the only thorn in my field of orange roses. The solitude becomes more than I can bear at times, and only when it becomes too great to bear do I ever dare leave my Gwendolyn. But I must confront it, even for a moment, to let myself remember why I tend my fields. People have come through that door before, I recall. I was with them. Fire burns in my belly to reopen the scar. They left me, stranded for an eternity, left to rot with no recourse. I cannot recall what my crime was after all these years, I can only remember my sentence.

You see, the fields are permitted to whither and scatter to the winds and elements. I am their master, and I leave them to die, only to revive them once again. I am not allowed that privilege myself. I do not wither, I cannot die. I endlessly tend my fields as a constant reminder of my pitiable state. I stopped aging centuries ago, I do not know why or how. There is much I do not know, all I know for certain is that I live, alone on a planet of endless domesticated plants. My wounds are healed miraculously through sleep, I have tried everything over the years to end my lot in life. Maybe it is the atmosphere of this strange planet that is so quick to grow plant life. Maybe that extends to myself as well. Maybe it is the monument. I like to think it is Gwendolyn, tending to me in the night. No matter the cause, the powers that be will not let me leave. They keep me here, in my eternal cage. 

I could hardly stand the monument. I left it soon after arriving here so long ago, looking for help. Finding nobody in all of my travels, I had lost track of it’s location. I was cast about for years with no landmarks, no memories of a less than memorable place. To my joyous surprise, I rediscovered the monument after about 30 years of wandering and scavenging, before I started farming. At the time there was still a vast variety of vegetation, Gwendolyn was teeming with every color, a rich and vibrant ecosystem. A century of vegetation had covered the pebbled, reflective surface, overgrowing to the point of obscurance. No amount of overgrowth could still my pounding heart, full with the hope of an escape after losing track of it for so long. The control panel was intact, still dimly lighting the buttons and switches that made up it’s face. Once cleared, my trembling finger reached out to engage the controls, to open my passage to freedom. 

The buttons did nothing. The switches did nothing. The endless variety of gadgets and gizmos formed a tapestry of technological artistry that overwhelmed my senses and confused my aching heart. At the end of my first week, my attempts did nothing but anger the monument, which began to emit a faint buzz from deep inside it. But that was far from the needed result to get me away from this empty planet, and no matter how hard I tried, nothing more ever came from it. I was ill equipped to solve the riddle, yet over the years I persisted. Every day I worked at the controls. I did not need food, I did not need sleep, all I needed was another moment basking in the glow of the monument. Days turned to years, the door remaining firmly closed. I was no closer to opening the door than the day that I started. I was in no hurry. Years turned to centuries. My captors were achingly superior. I was only a simple farmer caught in the grasp of something far larger than myself. I broke down further with every passing season, time slowly to a standstill. 

It was an anomaly. As sure as I could feel it’s exterior, smell it’s electric, metallic shell, and hear the gentle hum of it’s internal machinations, I was equally as sure that it was unknowable. No amount of sense and logic bound it’s workings, no law governed its actions. Like trying to sit upon a gaseous cloud, my hope died with each failed attempt. My last tie to humanity had no humanity in it, nothing fathomable by my finite understanding.

As I descended into madness, Gwendolyn was there. She held me close, sustained me, showed me the way. It was not in me to rework the design of my masters, to understand the intricate secrets of the door. But she opened my eyes. My task was laid out to me, in careful detail, by her beautiful nature surrounding me and the wretched monument. I would not need to learn these secrets on my own. I would see with my own eyes, the way through the door. The answers could not be found on my desolate home, so I would look upward, heavenward. The stars would hold my answer. I would find them.

I have grown carrots since. Hundreds of years of planting, growing and feasting on their orange flesh. I slowly uprooted the invasive plants, as well as other plants that were of no use to me. Carrots slowly spread across rolling countrysides, up into the highest reaches of the mountains where everything ceased to grow. Carrots reigned the entire planet over, alone with their gardener, their master. My belly was full, my purpose was clear, and slowly but surely, my eyesight began to improve.

It was nearly as imperceptible as the passage of time. My eyesight stretched further than in my youth, when I took those things for granted. I began to see details in the distance in such clarity as to think they were right in front of my face. Most importantly, I could see Gwendolyn for who she really was. She was more than soil, more than carrots, more than the comforting breeze. I could see that I loved her. 

When the distant mountains became a trifle, and there was nothing that I could not see, I journeyed to the top of the tallest mountain for the first and only time. Staring down upon my creation in stunning definition,with fields of beautiful green leaves in all directions,  there was only one more direction to look. The experience shook me to my center, and I knew there was nothing left for me here but my carrots, and my precious Gwendolyn. From that point on, I focused on the stars.

Another millennia had passed before I was able to focus far enough to settle on the first and closest planet. The carrots were working, I was peering into the darkest expanses of space, and planets began to peer back. I was able to make out large geographic areas, slowly learning to focus in on smaller details until I was counting the smallest grains of sand on an alien beach, thousands upon thousands of miles away. I pushed further and further into space, searching for the planet that was home to the same doors that chained me to this forsaken rock.

I spent lifetime after lifetime searching in vain. I sobbed like a child when I first saw an animal crawl out from under a steaming rock on a desert planet, the first developed life I had seen in thousands of years. I watched civilizations grow and fall, as planets orbited in and out of visibility in snapshots of life. Stranded on my own planet, with nothing but my carrots and my lover, sweet Gwendolyn, I watched the universe continue to turn. I was content to keep watching. I am a patient man.

As I combed further and further, learning and admiring the stars and the planets, time seemed to slow down, as if we were not all bound by the same sense of time. I began to find new appreciation for my curse, where one day elsewhere, would be much longer to me. In watching others, I often had decades more than them to understand their problems. I was helpless to influence their decisions, but all the same it provided meaning and clarity to me. I had all the time in the world, when everyone I watched felt so rushed. Time continued to stretch, and as my understanding of the universe grew, time became an ally and not a prison. Given enough time, I would have solved all of the universes’ woes, for every civilization and species since the dawn of time. I could see them all, yet they could not see me. I was still marooned alone with my carrots, seemingly trapped in both time and space.

Then finally, after 47,961 unfathomable years, I had done it. The carrots had worked. I couldn’t believe it for the first two hundred years afterwards. I convinced myself that the monolithic structures were just coincidental. The planet was so far away, that time slowed to a crawl, and it was difficult to make out every day actions when they moved so slowly. By my calculations, time moved at a rate of one year for me, and half of a day for them. Every minute for them, was nearly twelve hours for me. I had expected the universe to move past me in my thousands of years of solitude. With my life extending past the length of entire civilizations, it was impossible to imagine that those who brought me here have only lived a mere 60 years. The thought of perhaps my executioners still being alive was suddenly a real possibility. 

As I searched for those responsible for my sentencing, I began to study the monuments themselves, which were still very much present. They were on nearly every street corner, used daily by those who owned them. They were simply a form of transportation, teleporting someone through a door, then out another. Trained operators worked their magic across the control panel, flipping switches and pressing buttons. It brought a tear to my eye as I bore witness to their artistry, that even 50,000 years of trial and error could not mimic. There is nothing I have seen in my entire life that is as beautiful as the operator’s work, save for my darling green Gwendolyn.

I practiced year after year, working the buttons and switches until I understood everything I couldn’t learn on my own. It was masterful, the craftsmanship of these beautiful monuments that I despised so much. The moment that I was finally ready to open the door, was a moment I was unprepared for. 

My entire existence collapsed into one moment, and I was unsure if it was even what I wanted after all this time. I had spent my life frozen in time, and now my feet were nearly frozen in place. But I needed to go. I needed to confront them. They needed to see me with their own two eyes, and feel the anguish of 50,000 years of solitude. Oh, they would feel it. My entire existence has led up to this point. Every carrot I have eaten has been with this end goal in sight, and now it was finally here. 

With the greatest courage I could muster, I proceeded with the final gate codes, said my final goodbyes to my precious valley of carrots, and let tears stream down my face as light broke through the seam of the door. 

There was only one man left, of the six that had passed down the sentence of exile. A court panel judge, who had a beautiful wife and three children, now long grown and moved away. He lived in a small cabin on the edge of a lake, calmly living out his days at roughly 90 years old. His wife had left him over irreconcilable differences early on, and he was left to mull over the actions of his life in solitude. He was never much for conversation anyways.

The heyday of his thirties had taken it’s toll on him, and when the exile penalty had been outlawed over ethical grounds, he had taken a good hard look at himself and the consequences of his actions. It had been a byproduct of space exploration, to eject teleportation modules into the vast reaches of space. None of the spacemen aboard the small vessels had survived, and they weren’t built for space travel in the first place. But when the teleporters landed, they remained functional. Medical emitters would have  undeniably saved the explorers had they survived in any degree, but it’s a lot harder to heal someone that is dead on impact. Medicine had advanced a lot in the past one hundred years, but even eliminating natural deaths wasn’t enough to make crash landing any more natural. They lost a lot of good men in the early days, but it was a risk worth taking for progress.

Some teleportation modules landed on planets much too far away, that were too close to black holes or other anomalies. The time differential was too great, time would either move too quickly or too slowly to be useful. Those planets were the first to be repurposed into solitary prisons. The medical emitters in each module were disabled and safeguarded so that the prisoners would have no life support, inside or outside the module. There were more grains of sand in the ocean then there were chances for a prisoner to find the right combination of buttons and switches, there was no way to leave. 

All in all, it was a neat and tidy operation. You send a prisoner through, time passed 600 times faster, and they would be dead of natural causes within a few months at most. There were quite a few designated modules and planets, and the death penalty was used lightly, so most planets were only ever utilized a single time. One quick visit to confirm a dead body, never to be touched again. In all but one case, the bodies were found within a few miles of the module. Something about the lifelong hope of rescue stuck with these prisoners, which sounded like a dark, twisted joke to the judge.

But the judge certainly wasn’t laughing when, on a warm summer morning, his personal teleporter module fired up with an incoming payload. From his reclining sofa he sipped his morning coffee, and tilted his head down the hall towards his module. He wasn’t expecting anything or anyone, but any surprise was a good surprise at his age, so he rung it through. Out stepped a crazed old man with fingers stained bright green to the wrist, clutching two handfuls of the most dazzlingly orange carrots he had ever seen. “Who are you, and how did you get my module code? This is a private line, and you shouldn’t be here,” the judge called out nervously, shifting in his seat to better get a look at the intruder. The unsettling visitor continued slowly across the long room towards him, silently furrowing his brow, carrots shaking in his tense hands. The judge tried again to break the silence, “I’ll have you know, while those are the best looking carrots I’ve ever seen, I won’t be able to share them with you. I’m deathly allergic to carrots.” The judge’s voice cracked as he began to sweat, the man growing ever closer.

“I can see that,” uttered the man, as he took one last step to the edge of the recliner.
